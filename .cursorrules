# Portfolio Tech Stack Rules
- **Framework:** Astro 5.x. Always use the `---` frontmatter for components.
- **Animations:** Use GSAP for scroll-triggers. Always wrap GSAP in `<script>` tags so they run in the browser, not during the build.
- **Micro-interactions:** Use Framer Motion (framer-motion) for hovers.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4.0. Prioritize responsive design (mobile-first).
- **Cleanup:** Ensure all GSAP animations are killed on component unmount to prevent memory leaks.
- **Making choices** Always ask me before making choices yourself.
